### NSFW Content

No NSFW content is permitted here. Posting NSFW content will result in an immediate ban without warning. 

### Accept Others

Be kind and respectful of all members. We are tolerant of all races, genders, LGBTQ, religions, and creeds.  

### Addressing Conflicts

If you take issue with another member, discuss it with them PRIVATELY to come to a resolution. If you have done so and the issue is not yet resolved, the admins & mods are always open to assist in any way we can. It’s also worth noting that mods are not monitoring all channels 24/7, so members are expected to report issues if a mod is not available.  

### Logging

Actions that modify or delete content from the Discord are logged for reference if needed. This includes the content of messages PRIOR to modification, as well as the modified version of the message. 

### Constructive Criticism

Mods and the direction of the community are open to constructive criticism. If you feel the group is heading in the wrong direction or can be improved in some way, our minds will always be open to considerations. Blatant criticism and insulting mods, however, will not be tolerated and will result in a ban from the server. 

### No Patronizing

Feel free to celebrate wins and progress in your coding journey, but dont talk down to other members or make them feel beneath you or anyone else. Direct comparison of your own progress to others in a negative context will not be tolerated.

### Trolling

Trolling can be good natured fun, but can also sincerely offend people if they take it the wrong way. Keep trolling to a minimum and if you are offended by someone’s comments, discuss it with them to cultivate a positive outcome.
