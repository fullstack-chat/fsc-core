# fullstack.chat

Welcome to the core repository for [fullstack.chat](https://fullstack.chat), an actively growing podcast and community built for developers building and launching their own products.

## The community

Our Discord is an open community to not only connect with other builders and promote what you are working on, but also get advice on issues you might encounter and provide input if you can help others.

You DO NOT need to have actively shipped a product in order to join, even those who are considering the idea are encouraged to join to discuss your ideas with other active builders.

### Mission and values

Our mission is to be the #1 resource for developers who are building or shipping their own products with the goal of generating revenue to improve their lives and the lives of those around them.

We operate on 3 key principals:

- **Authenticity and integrity** &mdash; Members are expected to be honest and authentic at all times.
- **Kindness and openness** &mdash; With honesty, be respectfully nice. We all come from different walks of life and members should welcome others with open arms.
- **Willing altruism** &mdash; We're all here with a common goal. Be willing to lift others up, a high tide raises all boats.

All members are expected to adhere to these principals. Failure to do so will result in being banned from the community to protect other members.

### What we're not

While we are very open to new members, there are certain scenarios where the fullstack.chat. One thing our community is NOT is a Discord to learn software development or those who are looking for a traditional job in software.

**If you fit this description, you will still be welcome to join in the conversations, but there may be better options for you and your goals.**
