							<h3>NSFW Content</h3>
							<p>
								No NSFW content is permitted here. Posting NSFW content will
								result in an immediate ban without warning.
							</p>

							<h3>Accept Others</h3>
							<p>
								Be kind and respectful of all members. We are tolerant of all
								races, genders, LGBTQ, religions, and creeds.
							</p>

							<h3>Addressing Conflicts</h3>
							<p>
								If you take issue with another member, discuss it with them
								PRIVATELY to come to a resolution. If you have done so and the
								issue is not yet resolved, the admins & mods are always open to
								assist in any way we can. Itâ€™s also worth noting that mods are
								not monitoring all channels 24/7, so members are expected to
								report issues if a mod is not available.{' '}
							</p>

							<h3>Logging</h3>
							<p>
								Actions that modify or delete content from the Discord are
								logged for reference if needed. This includes the content of
								messages PRIOR to modification, as well as the modified version
								of the message.{' '}
							</p>

							<h3>Constructive Criticism</h3>
							<p>
								Mods and the direction of the community are open to constructive
								criticism. If you feel the group is heading in the wrong
								direction or can be improved in some way, our minds will always
								be open to considerations. Blatant criticism and insulting mods,
								however, will not be tolerated and will result in a ban from the
								server.{' '}
							</p>

							<h3>No Patronizing</h3>
							<p>
								Feel free to celebrate wins and progress in your coding journey,
								but dont talk down to other members or make them feel beneath
								you or anyone else. Direct comparison of your own progress to
								others in a negative context will not be tolerated.
							</p>

							<h3>Trolling</h3>
							<p>
								Trolling can be good natured fun, but can also sincerely offend
								people if they take it the wrong way. Keep trolling to a minimum
								and if you are offended by someoneâ€™s comments, discuss it with
								them to cultivate a positive outcome.
